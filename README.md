# Dedicated Device Using a Home Screen Admin App

This project demonstrates how to configure an Android device as a dedicated device using a hybrid approach. The app integrates both a Home Screen App and Device Administrator permissions, preventing users from exiting or uninstalling the app. It also restarts automatically after a crash or reboot.

## Features:
- Device Admin and Home Screen integration.
- Auto-start after boot.
- Immersive mode to hide system UI.
- Prevents back button actions.
